A variety of assignments I did during my certificate. I hope they represent my ability to follow instructions and do proper work.

BullsAndCows: A Wordle style number game in which you are assigned a random 4 digit number. Each attempt you will be given cows (the number of digits that are correct but not in the correct place) and bulls (the number of digits you have that are correct and that are in the correct place). Guesses must be 4 digit numbers and digits must not repeat. 

CoinMachine: A program that you run alongside the price paid for a product and the cost of the same product (all in cents). The program calculates the amount of change needed exactly.
Example run: Java CoinMachine.java 33 22
At which point it will show you the change offered for a 33 cent payment on a 22 cent item.

The Spice Bowl: An example web payment page for a spice and seasoning company with a focus on aesthetic and responsive ui. A midterm for my Web Development class. Some parts of code were provided for the template but the vast majority is my own.
