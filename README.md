A variety of assignments I did during my certificate.

BullsAndCows: A Wordle style number game in which you are assigned a random 4 digit number. Each attempt you will be given cows (the number of digits that are corret but not in the correct place) and bulls (the number of digits you have that are correct and that are in the correct place). Guesses must be 4 digit numbers and digits must not repeat.
